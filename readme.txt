This project aims to find the linear relation between different features and outcome variable. The features having strongest linear relationship are used to predict the outcome variable i.e. winnings.

#Working
1. First the features having a strong linear relation with the outcome variable is investigated using matplotlib and audio graphs.
2. Features showing the strongest linear relation are used to train the ML model and the magnitude of their relation is verified using coefficients.
3. The accuracy of the model is also calculated at the same time and then winning predictions are made after model validation.

#Outcome
breakpointsopportunities feature shows the strongest linear relationship
